<h1 align="center" id="title">RealWorld App</h1>

<p id="description">While most "todo" demos provide an excellent cursory glance at a framework's capabilities they typically don't convey the knowledge &amp; perspective required to actually build real applications with it. RealWorld solves this by allowing you to choose any frontend (React Angular &amp; more) and any backend (Node Django &amp; more) and see how they power a real world beautifully designed fullstack app called  <a href="https://demo.realworld.io/#/">Conduit</a> </p>

<p>This project is based on <a href="https://demo.realworld.io/#/">Conduit</a> and <a href="https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/specs/frontend-specs/swagger/">Conduit's API</a>  </p>
